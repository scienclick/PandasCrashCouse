## What is Pandas?
The Pandas library is one of the most popular and widely used Python libraries in data science and python programming. It stands for stands for “Python Data Analysis Library” and it has been a game changer in performing data manipulation and analysis. 
It is built on the top of Numpy package which allows Python to read in datasets from various formats, such as CSV file, TSV file, or a SQL database. It offers data structures in ‘DataFrame’ that allow you to read, store, select and manipulate tabular data in rows of observations and columns of variables.  It also lets you quickly grab statistics such as the meas value of a column. 

## Why is it important?
Pandas offers flexible data structures and provides easy syntax and fast operations. In combination with libraries such as matplotlib for data visualization and NumPy for statistics provides a package that is extensively for scientific computing in Python. 

## What you see in this document?
I have put together a tutorial in a form of Notebook in my GitHub repository that covers the basics of Pandas. It covers Pandas DataFrames, basic data manipulations that includes code samples. This tutorial has been prepared for those who seek for a quick guide to dive into Pandas common functions of Pandas. It gives you essentials of that you need to kickstart your data analysis fun in Python!

## How to install Pandas
The easiest way to get Pandas is to install it through the Anaconda distribution. Alternatively you can install pandas with: "pip install pandas" or "conda instal pandas"

## Requirements

The major libraries used in these projects are:
1. Pandas


## File structure

The notebook file is called **PandasCrashCourse.ipynb** and includes the following sections:

**Part 0: importing libararies**

**Part 1: grabing a specific column**

**Part 2: grabing multiple columns of data**

**Part 3: Using conditioning filtering to select certian rows and columns **

**Part 4: grabing unique values**

**Part 5: grabing all the column names of the data frame**

**Part 6: reporting back the information about the data frame**

**Part 7: reporting the statitics in the data**

**Part 8: reporting the range of index**

**Part 9: Creating a panda data frame using some Numpy generated numbers**
